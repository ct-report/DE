Contact Tracing - Germany

On April 26 Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a joint statement that German Federal Government would change their programs & adopt a decentralized model for the National contact tracing app.

Until April 24 Germany was still officially backing Fraunhofer HHI solution, based on centralized PEPP-PT/NTK protocol.

However, such centralized solution isn't supported by the new "Nofitication Exposures" APIs by Apple+Google for BLE contact-tracing (release to developers expected on April 28).

Therefore, also owing to current iOS issues with centralized BT proximity-tracing solutions, the German Government is now evaluating decentralized models, that could be compatibile with the new Apple+Google API. 

Not only DP^3T, but also TCN - used by former proposal **Ito** .
